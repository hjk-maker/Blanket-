# 🛡️ PROJECT BLANKET v6.4
**Sovereign Meta-Introspective Vision Framework**


Blanket is a self-governing AI architecture designed to solve the **Interpretability Gap**. Unlike standard black-box models, Blanket utilizes a recursive **Meta-Introspective Loop**—requiring the system to justify every data ingestion and pattern evolution event in real-time.



## 🧠 Core Architecture
* **Temporal TitanNet:** A 900-layer latent-walk engine ensuring visual stability.
* **Self-Why Engine:** A cognitive layer mapping system intent to execution.
* **Guardian Protocol:** A self-healing integrity system (Fixed.py).

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Ghost Ingestion:** Metadata-free web-cloning via `WebImageIngestor`.
- **Introspective Memory:** All logic is audited and stored in `consciousness.json`.
- **Hardware-Locked Security:** Bound to unique machine fingerprints.

## 🛠️ Installation
```bash
pip install customtkinter torch numpy opencv-python pillow requests beautifulsoup4
python blanket_v6_4.py
